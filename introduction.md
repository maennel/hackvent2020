# Introduction
It's Hackvent again!! But 2020 was still going at full speed and I really was in doubt, whether I would manage to bring up the time to solve all the challenges in time.
As usual I started with the idea to drop out at some point when work and HackVent would not fit into 24 hours anymore (did someone mention sleep?).

This year, the event started early on the 1st advent (the 29th of November 2020), which is really nice as I usually almost can't wait for it to start.

The following chapters describe how each one of the challenges was solved. 

This year I managed to solve all challenges, with one late submission, which is why I (ludus) don't figure in the top of the ranking. On day 16, Naughty Rudolph furbld that cube a little too hard, so I submitted the flag 23 minutes late.

I also want to mention that I would not have been able to submit almost all flags in time if there weren't some elves pulling me out of the numerous rabbit holes or even pushing into the right direction.

Huge thanks go to:

Many thanks also go to the organising team from Compass and to all the challenge authors!! It's a great event that I look forward to every year.

This year, in contrast to previous years, I found the level of the challenges to be more evened out throughout the entire month. I.e. harder challenges in the beginning, and less increase in the process.

Some challenges had a very guessy component, which is something I don't like too much.

Thanks to a more community driven approach I was able to unblock myself with the help of others either from the Discord server or via other channels.

Dear reader, have fun going through the challenges and my solutions. It would be great hearing from you if this inspires you to participate next year.


Yours,
