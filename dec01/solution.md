One of my very young Cyber Elves cut some parts of the card with his alpha scissors.

Have a great HACKvent,

â€“ Santa

## Approach
The "alpha scissors" hint in combination with the image's different appearance when being opened on my system made me think quickly that there must be a transparency (or "alpha") channel in the image.

Using the GIMP, I hid the image's Alpha channel and left RGB channels visible. That's how the flag became visible:
